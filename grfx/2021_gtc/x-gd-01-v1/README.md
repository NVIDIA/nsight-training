# Fundamentals of Ray Tracing Development using NVIDIA Nsight Graphics and NVIDIA Nsight Systems

With the arrival of NVIDIA RTX and realtime Ray Tracing APIs like DXR and Vulkan Ray Tracing, it's now easier than ever to create stunning visuals at interactive frame rates. In this workshop, you'll learn how to utilize NVIDIA Nsight Graphics to profile and optimize 3D Applications that are using Ray Tracing. Using an example application, you'll learn how to:
* Understand how modern GPUs function and how to properly feed the graphics pipeline
* Identify GPU bottlenecks that degrade performance by inspecting low level metrics
* Analyze profiler data and understand what actions you should take
* Optimize some example workloads to achieve peak performance
Upon completion, you should be able to leverage this knowledge to create workflows that can help you to improve your own applications.
