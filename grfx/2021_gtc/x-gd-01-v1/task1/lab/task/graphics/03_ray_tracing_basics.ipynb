    "## 03a - What is Ray Tracing\n",
    "Ray Tracing is simply another type of rendering algorithm that like rasterization, takes geometry created by artists and displays them on the screen. While rasterization works by projecting geometry onto the screen using a virtual camera, Ray Tracing more closely simulates how the real world works by tracing rays that are similar to light photons. Ray tracing can be very simple (such as with ray casting, where only a single primary ray is used) or very complex (such as with path tracing where those rays bounce around the scene, interactin with various media).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of algorithms and effects can be created using Ray Tracing:\n",
    "- Global Illumination (e.g. Path Tracing)\n",
    "- Reflections\n",
    "- Refraction\n",
    "- Subsurface Scattering\n",
    "- Ambient Occlusion\n",
    "- Depth-of-Field (i.e. Camera Focus)\n",

    "Ray Tracing relies on a few key concepts. Imagine if you had to test a ray against every triangle in a world with millions of triangles. Not so smart right? This is where Acceleration Structures help; they ensure that triangle intersection operations are as efficient as possible by minimizing unnecessary tests. They can be static or dynamic (in the case of animating objects, such as characters).\n",

    "Ray tracing involves shooting rays from every pixel on your screen and determining what they intersect with in your virtual world. In order to do this quickly, the world is subdivided into a top level and bottom level acceleration structure (also called TLAS and BLAS). The TLAS contains instances and transforms for the BLAS that it points to. The BLAS maintains an axis-aligned bounding box (or AABB) along with the geometry to render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Tracing in Vulkan requires a few new shader types:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image066.png\" width=\"800\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ray Generation Shaders are where your rays are spawned. This is effectively the entry point for the TraceRays API call.\n",
    "- Closest Hit Shaders are run when a ray intersects with scene geometry.\n",
    "- Miss Shaders execute when a ray does not intersect with anything in your scene. You might put your skybox code here as an example.\n",
    "- Intersection Shaders allow you to provide your own primitive intersection, for instance, spheres instead of AABBs.\n",
    "- Any Hit Shaders run when there is a non-opaque intersection and you would like to modify the intersection result. This is useful to implement alpha-testing since you can permit rays to keep going.\n",
    "- There's also a new shader type known as callable shaders that act like a subroutine, allowing you to dynamically execute a shader from within another shader (thus cutting down on the number of shader permutations needed and reducing the need for uber-shaders and excessive conditional branching).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a quick look in Nsight Graphics again. Open up the events list and look for vkCmdTraceRaysKHR. Using this inspector, we can verify that all of our shaders are properly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ray-shaders-inspector.png\" width=\"600\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "Acceleration structures help to speed up ray traversal across the world since doing a coarse test on a simpler shape, in this case, the AABB, is much faster than testing for a triangle intersection directly. NVIDIA Turing and Ampere Architecture GPUs have specialized hardware to do this efficiently, but even so, it's very important that these structures are properly fitted to geometry in order to ensure as few AABBs are tested as possible.\n",

    "One thing to keep in mind is that while rasterization has traditionally been very fast, ray tracing performance is comparible if proper tradeoffs are made. For instance, ray length is important as the longer a ray traverses the scene, the more objects must be considered. Reducing this may reduce visual fidelity, but likely at an imperceptable level while improving performance dramatically. It's up to you to experiment to find the best balance.\n"
