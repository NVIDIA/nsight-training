    "As an innovator of cutting edge 3D graphics, NVIDIA has created groundbreaking technologies like RTX and DLSS. The Turing and Ampere Architectures have ushered in a new era of graphics that makes realtime ray tracing a reality. In order to help you create innovative new applications that take advantage of these graphics features, you need to be able to fully utilize the capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA Developer Tools helps you do this by providing a rich and vibrant ecosystem of tools that you have free access to. Our goal is to provide developers like you full visibility of the GPU so you can make the best use of it.\n",

    "To use these tools effectively when profiling, we have recommended workflows that will help you identify and resolve problems as quickly as possible. The main workflow to consider is one that utilizes Nsight Systems to verify if you are CPU or GPU limited, resolving CPU issues, then moving on to Nsight Graphics to resolve GPU specific problems. Here is a graphic that demonstrates this workflow:\n",
