    "\n",
    "In this last practical step, we will review the unused memory detection\n",
    "capabilities of the Compute Sanitizer. The initcheck tool has an option\n",
    "that allows us to see if memory allocations are partly or completely unused\n",
    "during the life of the program. This can be useful when trying to reduce the\n",
    "waste of space in an application under high memory pressure. To use it we need\n",
    "to add the flag `--track-unused=yes` with the initcheck tool. For best results,\n",
    "we can have a `cudaDeviceReset()` at the end of the program if some allocations\n",
    "are not freed by that point. Let's try it with our application:\n",
