    "In this step, we will focus on the leak-detection capabilities of the compute-sanitizer. Indeed, the memcheck tool has an optional functionality other than\n",
    "detecting invalid memory accesses. It also allows to detect memory leaks, that\n",
    "is to say, device memory that has not been released when the program ends. To\n",
    "enable that check, we need to add the `--leak-check=full` flag. We also need to\n",
    "call `cudaDeviceReset()` at the end of our program for it work properly, which\n",
    "is the case here. Let's try to use it on our program:\n",
