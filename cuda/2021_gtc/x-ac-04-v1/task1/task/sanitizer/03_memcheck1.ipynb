    "# Debugging A Simple Image Processing Program Using The Compute Sanitizer\n",
    "## 03 Memcheck part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce the memcheck tool from compute-sanitizer.\n",
    "Memcheck is used to detect invalid memory access on the GPU, that is to say,\n",
    "memory accesses that are outside of a valid allocation, or memory accesses that are\n",
    "misaligned, which result in undefined behavior and may lead to application\n",
    "crashes or invalid results and corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build then run the application with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    nvcc convolution.cu -lpng -o convolution\n",
    "    ./convolution\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently run an edge-detection convolution matrix on the image\n",
    "[checkerboard.png](code/checkerboard.png) and an identity matrix on [icon.png](code/icon.png). The expected results\n",
    "are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Checkerboard ref](images/checkerboard-ref.png)\n",
    "![Icon ref](images/icon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we open [checkerboard-out.png](code/checkerboard-out.png) and [icon-out.png](code/icon-out.png) we can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Checkerboard fail 1](images/checkerboard-fail1.png)\n",
    "![Icon fail 2](images/icon-fail2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can suspect some form of memory corruption or a programming\n",
    "error that would lead to invalid memory access and try to run the compute-sanitizer memcheck tool. We can run memcheck with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    compute-sanitizer ./convolution\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `--tool memcheck` option is not necessary as memcheck is the\n",
    "default tool of the compute-sanitizer. We can see the following output:\n",
