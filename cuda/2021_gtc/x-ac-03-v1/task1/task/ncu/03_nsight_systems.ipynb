We can use NVIDIA's [Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) to collect a timeline of the application's CPU and GPU CUDA activities.

While the training phase makes up the longer part in our simplified test app, we want to focus on optimizing the detection phase. `In a real-world scenario`, both training and detection would run (since this is an online machine-learning code), but training also uses the detection code internally, making it the more valuable optimization target.\n",
