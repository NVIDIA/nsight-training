    "This lab teaches you how to use NVIDIA's [Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems), a system-wide profiler, to profile, analyze, and optimize applications. The exercises in this lab will focus on optimizing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training program (a version of the PyTorch's MNIST [example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist)) that detects hand-written digits. The techniques and strategies illustrated in this lab will translate to optimizing any application that uses NVIDIA's GPUs.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to do the following.\n",
    "- Run the sample application\n",
    "- Use Nsight Systems to profile the application\n",
    "- Interpret the timeline provided by Nsight Systems and understand the application's use of the system resources\n",
